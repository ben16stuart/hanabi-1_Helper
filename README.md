Not financial advice - especially since if have made $0 with this, but I'll keep telling myself it the economic climate and not the code. Also I think this was built to work on crypto? IDK.
This contains a front end GUI for hanabi-1 (which I had no part in building, but thought was cool).
Steps to set it up yourself
  -1. Install hanabi-1 locally.
  -2. Add these files to their existing file structure.
  -3. Fix & install a few dependencies
  -4. Fill in a few hardcoded paths
  -5. Use AAPL folder as a template for any stock you want to analyze. (I did 3)
