# Hanabi Helper Stuff

Not financial advice - especially since I have made $0 with this, but I'll keep telling myself its the economic climate and not the code. Also I think this was built to work on crypto? IDK.

This contains a front end GUI for hanabi-1 (which I had no part in building, but thought was cool so I made a user friendly interface). Added a couple other tweaks and features.

## Steps to set it up yourself:
  ###### 1. Install hanabi-1 locally.
  ###### 2. Add these files to the existing file structure.
  ###### 3. Probably Fix & install a few dependencies. Add a few missing directories.
  ###### 4. Install LLM with ollama.
  ###### 5. Profit? and retire early? (Not verified)
